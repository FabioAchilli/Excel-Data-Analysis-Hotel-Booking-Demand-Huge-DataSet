# Excel-Data-Analysis-Hotel-Booking-Demand-Huge-DataSet
A complex analysis in Excel of a huge dataset with booking information for a resort in Algarve, Portugal, with more than 800,000 values.

### Source:
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

### Original dataset and .csv file:
[Hotel Booking Demand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)

### Introduction to the dataset:

1. Original Dataset include booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, both in Portugal. 
2. Dataset includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, number of nights booked in week-day and in the week-ends, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, the source of the booking (direct client, corporate, travel agencies) and many other things. 
3. Original dataset has 119.390 rows, of which 79.330 for the City Hotel and 40.060 for the Resort Hotel. In order my laptop can handle the analysis I had to reduce the size of the data. 
4. The total of 119.390 rows are referred to a period of 3 years: 21.996 rows for year 2015, 56.707 rows for 2016 and 50.687 for 2017. 
5. I take only the year in the middle, that is year 2016, for two reasons: 1) it is the year with the greater number of data and 2) it is the year in between, so I can be sure that there are no weeks/months lost. 
6. Than I split the data for the two hotels, the City Hotel file with 38.140 rows and Resort Hotel file with 18.567 rows. 
7. I analyze this last Resort Hotel file, with more than 44 columns and more than 800.000 values

### The results of the analysis:

1. This is a several hour job ending with 9 spreadsheets, 23 pivot tables, 1 working sheet and 1 service table.
2. And this is only the first part of what a full and complete analysis could consist.
3. I am trying to give the first answers about: where clients come from, when clients book, number of bookings and how many booking are cancelled, source of bookings, differences for room/nights sold accordingly the source of booking, the month of stay, if clients are private ones or corporate, if they are singles, couples or familiesâ€¦
4. In order Excel for the Web (that require a max of 25MB file) to accept the link, I splitted my 35MB file in 2 different workbook files.
